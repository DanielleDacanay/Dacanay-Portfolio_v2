    <h1>The Product</h1>
    <p>Book’d is an appointment calendar app that helps restaurants and other businesses in the food industry manage
      dining reservations. Many restaurants still rely on handwritten appointment books to manage reservations. This can
      be overwhelming and at times unreliable. </p>

      <h1>Project Overview</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Challenge: </strong>Design an app that streamlines reservation management tasks and allows users to
        easily add, update and find reservations.

  <!--User Research-->
  <section class="intro" id="intro">
    <h1>User Research</h1>
    <p>In order to better understand the users and their needs, I conducted interviews and created empathy maps. A
      primary user group identified during the research was busy restaurant hosts who had more than one role on the
      staff. This user group confirmed some initial assumptions about restaurant hosts, but further research revealed
      that time constraints were only part of the causes for finding difficulty with bookkeeping. Other challenges
      included inconsistency and legibility.</p>

  <section class="detailed-content">
    <h2>Pain Points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Time </strong>&#8212; Employees often have multiple to perform roles, such as setting tables and answering phone calls, while guests
        wait at the entrance for their table.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Inconsistency </strong>&#8212; The amount of information that is noted down for a reservation varies from employee to employee
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legibility </strong>&#8212; Some employees have a difficult time reading the handwriting of others, which makes it challenging to find
        reservations quickly

      <h2>Paper Wireframes</h2>
      <p>When iterating on the home screen, I prioritized ease of access and minimalistic design to allow for easy
        navigation. When choosing the elements to include in the refined version, I opted for elements that were easy to
        understand and gave quick access to the most-used features.</p>

      <h2>Digital Wireframes & Low-fidelity Protoype</h2>
      <p>Designs included in the digital wireframes prioritized minimalistic elements that allowed users to take common
        actions quickly and easily. The low-fidelity prototype created in Figma from the digital wireframes focused on
        the Add Reservation user flow, which is the core feature of the app.</p>

  <!--Usability Findings-->
  <section class="intro" id="intro">
    <h1>Usability Findings</h1>
    <p>Two rounds of usability studies were conducted – one moderated and one unmoderated. Findings from the first study
      helped uncover major pain points with the initial design. The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and
      revealed what elements still needed refinement.</p>

  <div class="gallery">
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Round 1 Findings</h2>
      <li>Users wanted to filter information</li>
      <li>Users wanted a less cluttered calendar design</li>
      <li>Users wanted an edit option</li>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Round 2 Findings</h2>
      <li>Users were confused by the “Guest Book” label</li>

      <h2>Clutter-free</h2>
      <p>Usability studies revealed that users found it troublesome to scroll horizontally and vertically to see the
        rest of the reservations placed for the same time slot. I revised the design so that only <strong>vertical
          scrolling</strong> was only necessary to see future reservations. I also added a <strong>filter</strong>
        option for users who found the calendar overwhelming.</p>

      <p>The second usability study revealed that users responded better and had more positive first impressions with a

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>As I was designing this app, I learned that my interpretation of what a good and useful design is does not
        necessarily mean that it is the best design for what users need. The end-users’ perceptions are ultimately the
        most reliable deciding factors for app design.</p>
