    <h1>The Product</h1>
    <p>Ube & Sugar Bakery’s website allows customers to customize and place dessert orders online for delivery or
      in-store pick-up. Ube & Sugar Bakery currently only takes orders through phone or from messages on social media.
      This is a problem for new customers who aren’t familiar with their products and offerings.</p>

      <h1>Project Overview</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Challenge: </strong>Design a responsive website for a bakery that streamlines the browsing, ordering and
        checkout process for customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Role(s): </strong>UX Researcher, UI Designer
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Responsibilities: </strong>Conduct interviews and usability studies, create wireframes and prototypes,
        test for accessibility and iterate on designs
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Duration: </strong> January 2022 - February 2022 (5 weeks)
      </p>

        <strong>Tools: </strong> Figma, Adobe XD

  <!--User Research-->
  <section class="intro" id="intro">
    <h1>User Research</h1>
    <p>In order to better understand the users and their needs, I conducted interviews and created empathy maps. A
      primary user group identified during the research was on-the-go full-time employees who have limited time to run
      errands. This user group confirmed some initial assumptions about dessert-lovers who browse menus online, but
      further research revealed that lack of customization and inflexible pick-up times were common challenges customers
      face in addition to counterintuitive navigation.

    <h2>Pain Points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Time </strong>&#8212; Customers struggle to find a convenient pick-up/delivery time when placing
        last-minute custom cake orders
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Navigation </strong>&#8212; Customers find it frustrating to browse menus online and struggle to place
        orders on platforms other than desktops
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Customization </strong>&#8212; Customers who want custom cakes usually don’t see enough customization
        options online and must order in-store
        reservations quickly

      <h2>Paper Wireframes</h2>
      <p>When iterating on the home screen, I prioritized ease of access and prominence of product photos. When
        choosing
        the elements to include in the refined version, I opted for elements that <strong>emphasized the bakery’s
          products </strong>and
        gave <strong> quick access</strong> to the main product offerings.</p>

      <p>After refining the wireframe for the home screen, I created different iterations for various devices (desktop,
        tablet and mobile). When creating the different versions, I made sure that the key elements used for the desktop
        version were not lost or skewed. Each version prioritizes ease of use and visibility.</p>

  <!--Usability Findings-->

    <h1>Usability Findings</h1>
    <p>Two rounds of usability studies were conducted – one moderated and one unmoderated. Findings from the first
      study
      helped uncover major pain points with the initial design. The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and
      revealed what elements still needed refinement.</p>
  </section>
  <div class="gallery">
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Round 1 Findings</h2>
      <li>Users wanted feedback to confirm an item was added to their cart</li>
      <li>Users were confused by the progress tracker in the checkout flow</li>
      <li>Users wanted a way to order more than one of the same item</li>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Round 2 Findings</h2>
      <li>Users found the confirmation message obstructive and wanted a way to keep browsing without acknowledging the
        message every time</li>
      <li>Users wanted a way to see the order status</li>

      <p>Usability studies revealed that customers wanted <strong>actionable feedback</strong> when they added an item
        to their cart. The
        informational text was sufficient for some customers, but the majority of users wanted a way to actually verify
        the action and view their cart.</p>

      <p>The usability study showed that customers found the checkout progress tracker confusing and didn’t find it
        helpful at all when trying to figure out how many steps were left. <strong>Iconography and colors</strong> were
        used to better inform the customer of where they currently were and what was coming next.

    <h1>Accessibility Considerations</h1>
    <p>In order to better understand the users and their needs, I conducted interviews and created empathy maps. A
      primary user group identified during the research was busy restaurant hosts who had more than one role on the
      staff. This user group confirmed some initial assumptions about restaurant hosts, but further research revealed
      that time constraints were only part of the causes for finding difficulty with bookkeeping. Other challenges
      included inconsistency and legibility.</p>

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>As I was designing this responsive website, I learned that my interpretation of what a good and useful design
        is does not necessarily mean that it is the best design for what users need. The end-users’ perceptions are
        ultimately the most reliable deciding factors for app design.
