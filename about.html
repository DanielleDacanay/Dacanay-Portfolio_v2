<section class="about" id="about">
  <h2>Business Analyst</h2>
  <p>As a full-time Business Analyst on an Agile government project, I regularly engage with our clients to determine underlying business problems, gather requirements and propose innovative solutions that meet their expectations. In additon, I serve as a Scrum Master, Product Owner and Tester as needed. As part of regular release activities, I maintain documentation such as requirement specifications, conduct Sprint demos for the client and facilitate user acceptance testing.</p>
  <br>  
  <h2>UX Researcher & UI Designer</h2>
  <p>With each project release, I continuously learn how client interacts with the system and determine ways to improve the system to fit their needs while enhancing the user experience. Prior to development, I create visual workflows and mockups to help my Scrum team and the client converge onto one vision. To broaden and strengthen my understanding of the user experience, I am currently part of a FedTech case study under the ACT-IAC Customer Experience (CX) Community of Interest.</p>   
  <br>
  <h2>Developer</h2>
  <p>While studying Computer Science at the University of Virginia, I learned that I truly enjoyed front-end development and could spend hours developing user interfaces. Since I no longer have the same technical exposure as I did at school during my 9-5 job, I use some of my time outside of work strengthening my technical skills by creating projects and learning new technologies. I am currently working towards becoming a cross-functional Scrum team member (BA/App developer).</p>
